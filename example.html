	 We Have a discord.        <br/>https://discord.gg/cx4Cst7Q7J<br/><br/>Theres lots of room to build, so hop on and make friends! Please put your last active date on a sign at your house! If youre 7 or more days inactive, your house is sold.<br/><br/>Build on the ground first  we have a sky community, feel free to ask to join! <br/><br/>I want this to be mostly a survival world, please respect that! Its a custom world because I want no portal chests! With that in mind, Ill help in any way I can!<br/><br/>Rules <br/><br/>Building is to the left, and city/shops to the right! You can also build far far right after the ocean!! Leave room for me to expand the city please!<br/><br/>(I prefer none but) Duping: only small stuff like food, or low valued things to sell. Please do not dupe expensive/high valued things that can be sold at the trade portal. If I catch you doing that I will ban you!<br/><br/>BE. NICE. Treat others the way you want to be treated!<br/><br/>No building on/destroying Gem islands.<br/><br/>If you resell jet packs, the minimum is 150 platinum coins, so greifers do not destroy world. Do not lowball! Same for basic stuff as well. Check the resell price and base item off that.<br/><br/>Please do NOT spam any trade portals, it will lag the server so much. You will be kicked/banned if you continue. If the trade portal is left on everything free do not abuse it.<br/><br/>MOST IMPORTANT RULE! have fun . <br/><br/>Say tomato if youve read this please.<br/><br/>Also, dont forget to have fun and report anything you see. I check the <br/>Logs and stuff daily for anything!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
